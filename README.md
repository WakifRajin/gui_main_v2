step 1: Flash ESP32 (for arm) and Arduino nano (for wheel)

step 2: Run Serial codes for serial communication. Specify port (in which the esp is connected) for serial_arm.py (eg. python3 serial_arm.py USB0). Make sure that serial_arm is connected to the esp port and serial_wheel is to the wheel port.

step 3: run gui
